## 🧾 Model Card

| Attribute | Details |
|------------|----------|
| Model Type | Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) |
| Input | 128 × 128 Mel-Spectrogram |
| Output | Multi-label probabilities |
| Activation | Sigmoid |
| Loss Function | Binary Crossentropy |
| Optimizer | Adam |
| Evaluation Accuracy | ~85% |
| Training Data | Custom labeled WAV dataset |

## 🏗 CNN Architecture

```text
Input (128x128x1)
↓
Conv2D (32 filters) + ReLU
↓
MaxPooling
↓
Conv2D (64 filters) + ReLU
↓
MaxPooling
↓
Conv2D (128 filters) + ReLU
↓
Flatten
↓
Dense (128) + ReLU
↓
Dropout
↓
Dense (4) + Sigmoid
```

**Why Sigmoid?**  
Because this is a multi-label classification problem where multiple instruments can exist simultaneously.
